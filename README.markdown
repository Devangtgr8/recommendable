# Recommendable [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/davidcelis/recommendable)

Recommendable is an engine for Rails 3 applications to quickly add the ability for your users to Like/Dislike items and receive recommendations for new items. It uses Redis to store your recommendations and keep them sorted by how good the recommendation is.

Requirements
------------
* Ruby 1.9.x
* Rails 3.x or 4.x
* Sidekiq or Resque (or DelayedJob)

Bundling one of the queueing systems above is highly recommended to avoid having to manually refresh users' recommendations. If running on Rails 4, the built-in queueing system is supported. If you bundle [Sidekiq][sidekiq], [Resque][resque], or [DelayedJob][delayed_job], Recommendable will use your bundled queueing system instead. If bundling Resque, you should also include ['resque-loner'][resque-loner] in your Gemfile to ensure your users only get queued once (Sidekiq does this by default, and there is no current way to avoid duplicate jobs in DelayedJob).

Installation
------------

Add the following to your Rails application's `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
  gem 'recommendable'
```

After bundling, run the installation generator:

``` bash
$ rails g recommendable:install
```

Double check `config/initializers/recommendable.rb` for options on configuring your Redis connection. After a user likes or dislikes something new, they are placed in a queue to have their recommendations updated. If you're using the basic Rails 4.0 queue, you don't need to do anything explicit. If using Sidekiq, Resque, or DelayedJob, start your workers from the command line:

``` bash
# sidekiq
$ bundle exec sidekiq -q recommendable
# resque
$ QUEUE=recommendable rake environment resque:work
# delayed_job
$ rake jobs:work
```

Usage
-----

In your Rails model that will be receiving recommendations:

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  recommends :movies, :shows, :other_things
  
  # ...
end
```

That's it! Please note, however, that you may only do this in one model at this time.

For more details on how to use Recommendable once it's installed and configured, [check out the more detailed README][recommendable] or see the [documentation][documentation].

Installing Redis
----------------

Recommendable requires Redis to deliver recommendations. The collaborative filtering logic is based almost entirely on set math, and Redis is blazing fast for this. _NOTE: Your redis database MUST be persistent._

### Homebrew

For Mac OS X users, homebrew is by far the easiest way to install Redis.

``` bash
$ brew install redis
```

### Via Resque

Resque (which is also a dependency of recommendable) includes Rake tasks that
will install and run Redis for you:

``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/resque.git
$ cd resque
$ rake redis:install dtach:install
$ rake redis:start
```

Redis will now be running on localhost:6379. After a second, you can hit `ctrl-\` to detach and keep Redis running in the background.
